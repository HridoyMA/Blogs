# Implementation Mistakes by Devs: Why you should not use `useEffect`

The `useEffect` hook in React is a versatile tool for functional components. It helps with tasks like fetching data or updating the webpage. But, like any tool, it's important to use it wisely. Using `useEffect` too often can clutter your code. While it's great for certain tasks, it's not always the best choice. You need to be smart about when and how you use it to keep your React code clean and efficient.

##  Unnecessary Performance Impact

Imagine you're making a cake. You have a recipe with several steps. Each time you complete a step, you check the recipe to see what to do next. Now, think of `useEffect` like that recipe. It tells your React component what to do when certain things change, like when a variable's value changes.

But, just like if you were baking, if you keep checking the recipe unnecessarily or if you're not careful with what ingredients you need, you might waste time and ingredients. In coding terms, this means unnecessary work and slower performance for your app.
Let's say you have a simple React component that updates a counter whenever a button is clicked:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count changed:', count);
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
In this example, the `useEffect` runs every time the component renders. So, whenever you click the button to increment the count, even though the effect doesn't actually do anything except log to the console, it still runs every time, which can slow down your app if you have more complex operations inside the effect.

To avoid unnecessary re-renders and performance impacts, you can optimize your effects by specifying dependencies. In this case, since the effect only depends on the `count` variable, you can pass it as a dependency to `useEffect`:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Count changed:", count);
}, [count]);
```
Now, the effect will only run when the count variable changes, avoiding unnecessary re-renders and improving performance.

## Incorrect Dependency Management
Think of `useEffect` as a function that watches for changes in specific things and then does something in response. But if you forget to tell it about all the things it needs to watch, it might not do what you expect.
Imagine you have a function that makes coffee when you have both water and coffee beans. If you forget to check if you have enough coffee beans, you might end up making coffee without them, which would taste terrible!
Let's see a simple code example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function CoffeeMaker() {
  const [water, setWater] = useState(false);
  const [coffeeBeans, setCoffeeBeans] = useState(false);

  // This useEffect should make coffee when both water and coffeeBeans are true
  useEffect(() => {
    if (water && coffeeBeans) {
      console.log('Time to make coffee!');
      // Code to make coffee goes here
    }
  }, [water]); // Only water is included in the dependency array

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setWater(true)}>Add water</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCoffeeBeans(true)}>Add coffee beans</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CoffeeMaker;
```
In this example, we want to make coffee when both water and coffeeBeans are true. But we only include water in the dependency array of `useEffect`. So, if we add water, the effect runs, but even if we then add coffee beans, the effect doesn't run again because it's not watching for changes in coffeeBeans. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Stale Closures

Think of a closure like a little bubble that contains some information. In React, when you use `useEffect`, you're creating these bubbles that capture the values of variables from your component. But if those values change later on, the bubbles still remember the old values, which can cause problems. This is what we call a "stale closure."
Let's break it down with a simple example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';


function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);


  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('Current count:', count);
    }, 1000);


    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs only once


  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };


  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}


export default Counter;
```
Here, we have a simple counter component that increments the count every time you click a button. We also have a `useEffect` that logs the current count every second.
Now, the problem here is that the console.log inside `useEffect` captures the count variable. But since `useEffect` only runs once (because of the empty dependency array []), it captures the initial value of count, which is 0. Even if count changes later when you click the button, the closure inside `useEffect` still remembers the old value, so it always logs 0.
To fix this issue and make sure `useEffect` captures the updated value of count, we need to include count in the dependency array:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Current count:', count);
  }, 1000);

  return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
}, [count]); // Now, useEffect depends on count

useEffect(() => {
  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Current count:', count);
  }, 1000);

  return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
}, [count]); // Now, useEffect depends on count
```
Now, whenever count changes, `useEffect` will run again with the updated value, and the closure won't become stale anymore.

### ** Instead of using `useEffect`, there are other approaches you can consider:

## Use Memoization

Imagine you have a React component that displays a list of items. Each time something changes in your component, React might rerender it to reflect those changes. This can be inefficient if your component doesn't really need to rerender.
One way to optimize this is by using memoization. It's like taking a snapshot of something and only updating it when necessary.
In React, you can use useMemo and useCallback to memoize values and functions, respectively. Here's how it works:

```javascript
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

const MyComponent = ({ items }) => {
  // Memoize the result of rendering the list
  const renderedList = useMemo(() => {
    return items.map((item) => <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>);
  }, [items]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My List</h1>
      {renderedList}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
In this example, useMemo takes a function and an array of dependencies. It runs the function and memoizes the result. If any of the dependencies change, it reruns the function. So here, the renderedList will only be recalculated if the items prop changes, preventing unnecessary rerenders.
Similarly, useCallback can be used to memoize functions, ensuring they don't change unless their dependencies change.
By using memoization techniques like these, you can optimize your React components and improve performance by avoiding unnecessary rerenders.

## Encapsulate Effects
Imagine you have a bunch of tasks you need to do, like fetching data from a server or setting up event listeners. Instead of scattering these tasks throughout your code, you can bundle them together into a custom hook. This hook can then be used anywhere in your code whenever you need to perform those tasks.
Here's a simple example:
Let's say you have a component where you want to fetch some data from an API when it mounts. Instead of writing the fetch logic directly inside the component, you can encapsulate it into a custom hook called useFetchData.

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Custom hook to fetch data
function useFetchData(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const jsonData = await response.json();
        setData(jsonData);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }

    fetchData();

    // Cleanup function
    return () => {
      // Cleanup logic here if needed
    };
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading };
}

// Example component using the custom hook
function MyComponent() {
  const { data, loading } = useFetchData('https://api.example.com/data');

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return <div>{/* Render your data here */}</div>;
}
```
In this example, useFetchData encapsulates the logic for fetching data from an API. This hook can now be reused in any component that needs to fetch data, making our code more modular and easier to understand.

## Conclusion

So, `useEffect` in React is like a handy tool that helps you do things after your components have rendered. But, like any tool, it has its tricky parts. By knowing the common mistakes and doing things the right way, you can make the most out of `useEffect` without messing up your code. Just remember to use it wisely, tidy up after you're done with it, be careful with what you put in its dependency list, and don't use it too much for managing your state.
